# Lab8: Final Project

Lab 8 is the final project of this course, and consists of adding a two user interactive feature of our choice.
I chose to add the capability of commenting on blogs. Two different icons show up on blogs (must be logged in to see any icons). 
These links will take the user to either a page where all the blog comments are listed, or to a page where they can add their own comment.
Each blog comment has text that indicates who authored the comment.

My web page with the end product of the labs can be found [here](http://3.237.172.53/)
