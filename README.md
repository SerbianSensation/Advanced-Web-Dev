# Lab4: REST API Website

Added a REST API to the website. The api deals with getting, adding (post), updating (put), and deleting blogs. The front end was edited to have the controllers send requests to the api in order to complete the necessary action. The blogs are no longer static and accessed from the front-end controllers, but rather are accessed from and added to the MongoDB.
 

Edit Blog and Delete Blog pages were officially completed. They are linked to using icons on each of the blog posts. Each of these pages successfully gets the ID of the blog, and updates or deletes the blog accordingly.
