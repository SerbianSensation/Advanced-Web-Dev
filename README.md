# Lab8: Final Project

Lab 8 is the final project of this course, and consists of adding a two user interactive feature of our choice.
I chose to add the capability of commenting on other peoples blogs. Two different icons show up on blogs
that are not created by the logged in user. These links will take the user to either a page where all the blog comments
are listed, or to a page where they can add their own comment.

My web page with the end product of the labs can be found [here](http://3.237.172.53/)
