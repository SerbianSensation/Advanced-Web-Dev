# Lab3: Data Driven Website

Officially converted the app to a MVC architecture by adding the model using MongoDB to add a database. Added 3 blogs to blogList by sending static data from the controller to the view. 
Added 2 new pages: Edit Blog and Delete Blog, which are linked to using icons on each of the blog posts. Both of these pages are under construction and will be worked on in future Labs.
